Supplementary video 1 : Displays a 99% POPC 1% Rhod PE MagneHis vesicle imaged at 20 x under a fluorescent microscope. Vesicle was made through phase transfer with 1 mg/ml MagneHis particles. Vesicle can be seen as the white sphere in the top right migrating to the bottom left hand corner by the action of a 1 Tesla magnetic feild. Black particles represent MagneHis aggregates which migrate alongside the vesicle according to a magnetic feild. 

Supplementary video 2 : Shows gels made on-chip by the acetic acid method with 5 mg/ml magnetic particles migrating towards a 1 Tesla magnet positioned at 2.5 mm from the well centre. 

Supplementary video 3 : Shows gels made on-chip by the acetic acid method with 5 mg/ml magnetic particles migrating towards a 1 Tesla magnet positioned 3 mm from the well centre.

Supplementary video 4 : Shows gels made on-chip by the acetic acid method with 5 mg/ml magnetic particles migrating towards a 1 Tesla magnet positioned 4 mm from the well centre. 

Supplementary video 5 : Shows gels made on-chip by the acetic acid method with 5 mg/ml magnetic particles responding to a 1 Tesla magnet positioned 17 mm from the well centre. 

Supplementary video 6 : Shows hybrid gels being guided to the first junction in a T-junction maze. Gels made on chip by the calcium chloride suspension method 5 mg/ml magnetic particles and 1 ml of liquid E. coli OD 0.1 - 0.2 resuspended in 500 μl of alginate

Supplementary video 7 :  Shows hybrid gels being guided to the final well in a T-junction maze. Gels made on chip by the calcium chloride suspension method 5 mg/ml magnetic particles and 1 ml of liquid E. coli OD 0.1 - 0.2 resuspended in 500 μl of alginate

Supplementary video 8 : Shows on-chip production of gels with 5 mg/ml magnetic particles by the acetic acid method.
