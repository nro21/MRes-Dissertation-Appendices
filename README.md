Supplementary video 1 : displays a 99% POPC 1% Rhod PE MagneHis vesicle imaged at 20 x under a fluorescent microscope. Vesicle was made through phase transfer with 2 mg/ml MagneHis particles. Vesicle can be seen as the white sphere in the top left migrating to the bottom right hand corner according to a 1 Tesla magnetic feild. Black particles represent MagneHis aggregates which migrate alongside the vesicle according to a magnetic feild.
