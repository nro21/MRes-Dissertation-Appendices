Supplementary video 1 : displays a 99% POPC 1% Rhod PE MagneHis vesicle imaged at 20 x under a fluorescent microscope. Vesicle was made through phase transfer with 2 mg/ml MagneHis particles. Vesicle can be seen as the white sphere in the top left migrating to the bottom right hand corner according to a 1 Tesla magnetic feild. Black particles represent MagneHis aggregates which migrate alongside the vesicle according to a magnetic feild. 

Supplementary video 2 : Shows gels made on-chip by the acetic acid method with 5 mg/ml magnetic particles at a 2.5 mm distance from the magnet. 

Supplementary video 3 : Shows gels made on-chip by the acetic acid method with 5 mg/ml magnetic particles at a 3 mm distance from the magnet. 

Supplementary video 4 : Shows gels made on-chip by the acetic acid method with 5 mg/ml magnetic particles at a 4 mm distance from the magnet. 

Supplementary video 5 : Shows gels made on-chip by the acetic acid method with 5 mg/ml magnetic particles at a 17 mm distance from the magnet. 

Supplementary video 6 : Shows hybrid gels being guided to the first junction in a T-junction maze. Gels made on chip by the calcium chloride suspension method 5 mg/ml magnetic particles and 1 ml of liquid E. coli OD 0.1-0.2 resuspended in 500 μl of alginate

Supplementary video 7 :  Shows hybrid gels being guided to the final well in a T-junction maze. Gels made on chip by the calcium chloride suspension method 5 mg/ml magnetic particles and 1 ml of liquid E. coli OD 0.1-0.2 resuspended in 500 μl of alginate

Supplementary video 8 : Shows on-chip production of gels with 5 mg/ml magnetic particles by the acetic acid method.
